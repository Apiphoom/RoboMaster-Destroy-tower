# Fight and Destroy the tower! 
Use your Robomaster S1 to destroy enemy tower and you will win!
 
 But be careful, the enemy will also be using their own Robomaster S1 to defend their tower. Make sure to use your weapons and tactics effectively to outsmart them. Remember to keep an eye on your surroundings and stay alert for any incoming enemy attacks. Communication with your team is key to success, coordinate your moves and work together to take down the enemy tower. Don't hesitate to ask for help or assistance if needed. Stay focused and stay determined, you can do this! Remember to have fun and enjoy the game."
